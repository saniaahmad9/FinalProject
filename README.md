# GWU Bootcamp Final Project 
*Project completed by: Sania Ahmad, Haris Nawzadi, Sayed Zewari*

For our Final Project, we built a Flask app all about the International Space Station (ISS). View our site to see a live ISS tracker and learn more about the path the ISS takes around the world. We pushed our app to Heroku, so you can see it too!
